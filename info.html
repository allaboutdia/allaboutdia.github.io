       Within the school, there are many places where the students hang out. Of these,
       there are a few notable areas. The first is the Quad, a rectangle shaped piece grass near the entrance.
       Another is the Learning Garden, the Cafeteria, or within the hallways in the school. If you go near these
       areas you are sure to find more people.
       <br> <br>
       There are a variety of clubs and extracurricular activites at our school as well.
       There are many students who are active within these clubs and it will be easy
       to meet new people through these clubs.
       The one club that would be recommended to meet new people would be Model United Nations.
       There are many people in the club, and it also helps build your communication skills.
